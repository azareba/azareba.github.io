## [Shrek the Third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MoIr7811Bs&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesClassicTrailers) (2007)

In the plot, Prince Charming is plotting to overthrow Shrek and Fiona, who have inherited the throne following King Harold's death. Shrek, who does not want to rule the kingdom and does not believe an ogre is fit to be king, attempts to convince Fiona's underachieving, 16-year-old cousin Artie to reign instead.
